<h1>The Program</h1>

<b>Have you ever had a phone alarm go off at a time that would be 
    considered inappropriate?</b>

          Have you ever had a phone alarm go off at a time that would be 
    considered inappropriate? For example having your phone go off during 
    a lecture hall, or a funeral would be both distracting for others, and 
    embarrassing for you. If you are like me and have a sleep schedule that has 
    fallen into disarray, then you tend to set alarms as you need them, then 
    forget about them, only to have them go off the next week at and undesired 
    time.  This is a problem that many people deal with, and that I wanted to 
    fix using the Wifi Alarm App.
      
          The way this program works is simple.  Just like any other alarm 
    clock, you can set alarms for times and days of the week.  However, each 
    alarm also allows you to pick wifis out of a list of your saved Wifi 
    connections.  You can then blacklist these connections, for example if you 
    didn't want your alarm to go off at school, then you could simply blacklist 
    your school wifi connection. As long as you were connected to a blacklisted 
    wifi, the alarm would be unable to go off.
    
          In addition to this, you could also do things inversely. If you wanted 
    an alarm to go off only when you were at home, then you could isolate your 
    home wifi and any other wifis you would like it to go off inside and the alarm
    would only ring while you were connected to these connection points.
    
<h1>Technical Decisions</h1>
          
          While making this app, there were a few decisions I had to make.  One of
    original ideas was to make the app based off of your location instead of off
    of your wifi connection.  However, after implementing this idea, we found that 
    having location on your phone set to active all the time really kills your 
    your battery.  In addition to this, the app would constantly have to check to 
    see if you were within the location every minute, whereas the wifi would only
    have to be checked every time you either connected or disconnected to a wifi
    source.
    
<h1>What I Learned</h1>
            
           I think the main thing I learned from this project was the use of 
    Android Studios as a development tool.  I already knew how to use Java before 
    I worked on this project, however I still had difficulty learning the unique
    differences of the Android Studios APIs.  However, now that I know how to 
    develop for mobile apps, it is a lot easier to compete in Hack-a-thons.
