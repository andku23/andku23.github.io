I did a techfolios project for 314.  Despite having used github before,
I'm not exactly great at using it.  The main reason for that is this is because
every single time I've had a group project, I end up doing the whole damn thing.
Since I'm usually the only one working on it, I have to do minimal work on github.
As a result I'm not amazing at Github which made the Techfolios project harder than
it should have been.  I still managed to finish it but at one point i really messed 
something up and had to delete the repo and start over.
