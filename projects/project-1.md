<h1>The Program</h1>

         The Holographic Accelerated Learning Environment (HALE) is a 
    Mixed Reality program that will use a series of holograms to train 
    a user to use any device within a room.  This use of Mixed Reality 
    as a teaching tool will allow the user to be able to see an 
    interactive set of instructions projected into the real world, 
    allowing them to learn in an augmented version of the working 
    environment.
    
        The HALE will be able to be used in two main steps.  First, an instructor 
    will put on the hololens and proceed to use the program to document a room or 
    object.  Documenting a room will consist of creating holograms within the 
    world that will display things such as drawings and annotations, written 
    instructions, usage tips for devices, points of interest, audio recordings 
    and warning markers.  The instructor will be able to create as many or as 
    little notes as they would like within the 3D environment.  Once the 
    instructor feels that they have an adequate amount of notes to teach a new 
    user, they can save all of the holograms they created in their overlay to a 
    file.  This file can either be stored locally within the hololens, or 
    uploaded to a server.  
    
        When a student or new user  would like to learn how to use the documented 
    material, they will be able to use the file saved by the instructor.  The user 
    can either put on the same hololens as the instructor, or their own hololens 
    containing the HALE program and download the hologram file from a server.  
    Once the file is downloaded the user will be able to see all of the notes that 
    the instructor created.  The user will be able to learn more efficiently by 
    being able to see all of the annotations within the actual work environment.
