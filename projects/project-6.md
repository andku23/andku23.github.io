## Introduction

Winds of Sarkha is a dream-list game that I've always want to make.  I wanted to have a game that combined the exploration of procedurally rendered terrain, with all of the adventure of an RPG.  All of this tied together with a character controller that could properly explore and battle.  This is definitely not a game that I am finished with, I've actually barely started.  I have started on a very basic idea for the game.  I have drawn some concept art, and also started learning how to write Compute Shaders in order to learn how to render and calculate the procedural terrain in the GPU.  

## The Art



I have a pretty basic idea of what I want this game to look like.  Lately I've been trying to put my ideas down on paper where I can see them.

## Compute Shaders

Prior to starting this, I have had no prior experience in writing anything GPU related.  I thought that a good way to go about learning would be to read some books on it so I started reading the Nvidia book on CG as well as some of their GPU Gems.  From the GPU Gems I found out about the marching cubes algorithm, which is an algorithm used to create voxel terrain.  I did my best to implement this code, starting by doing it in the CPU, and when I finally got that working, in the GPU.  Eventually I had a couple compute shaders that could make very simple voxel terrain.  So far that's as much as I've gotten.



## Conclusion

For the Game Jam there were 3 categories, Best Overall, Most Creative, and Most Diverse.  Our game took Most Diverse because of its absolute craziness and our use of the additional themes that we were given.  Last Game Jam I had tagged along with a group and only contributed minimally.  This year it was nice to have my own team and be one of the major contributors to the game.
