My friend and I are trying to go into Game Design so we are working
on somewhat of a portfolio project to present during the application
process.  We basically started this project during the summer of 2017
and we came out with V1 of the project.  We weren't too proud of this so 
the following semester we came out with V2 which was the same game but one
that we were quite proud of.  Finally this semester we plan on working on
V3, the final version of the project.
