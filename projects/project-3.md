## Introduction 

The Alexa Game was a sword combat game that my friend and I wanted to create.  Looking at a lot of other games with sword combat, we noticed that a lot of them used roughly the same combat system.  Most games had an attack button to do attacks, and a block button to block incoming attacks. Some other systems had slightly more complex systems where they would also have heavy attacks, or parrying.  We wanted to try do something that felt a little more interactive.  We decided to have system that had, right attacks, left attacks and heavy attacks as well as right blocks, left blocks, and heavy dodges.  The way our system works is that right blocks can block right attacks, left blocks can block left attacks, and dodging can avoid heavy attacks.  We felt that this system provided more of a challenge by making you focus on how your enemy was attacking you.  We also implemented a combo system where attacks did more damage when you linked them together in certain ways.  Certain combos would take longer than others. The longer the combo, the greater the damage multiplier, but the longer you were unable to defend getting hit by an enemy.

## Alexa I

Alexa I or Alexa version 1.0 was a project my best friend and talented coder, Shuhei Aoki, worked on for the summer of 2017. This was our first attempt at trying to implement the combat system we thought of.  The goal of this project was to learn the workflow of developing a game from start to finish. We also wanted to have a game to put on our portfolio when we applied for jobs since we did not have any prior games to show.  As always I took over the art side of the project (3d Modeling, texturing rigging, animating, environment design), and Shuhei took over the programming half of the project (Character Control, Camera Rig, Game Logic, Enemy AI). Between the two of us we created the entire game, which we name Alexa V1.
    
After designing our first game, we realized that there were a lot of parts that we rushed, and a lot of parts we could do better.  With this,  we decided that we would redesign the game from scratch over the next semester.
    
## Alexa II

Alexa II (Alexa version 2.0), was the second iteration of the Alexa project.  For this version, I took up the majority of the programming as well as the art, since my professor gave me the green light to turn this in as the final project for his class.  The first thing I had to do was learn the design structure that Shuhei used to make the game work.  This was probably the hardest part.  Not because the code was messy, because he did a very good job of keeping things organized, but because of the pure bulk of code that was in the game.  After I learned how the project worked, it was pretty easy for me to incorporate new features to the game.

The other part of the project I had to complete was the artistic side. I was not satisfied with my art from the first version of the game so I wanted to do a complete artistic overhaul.  This meant completely recreating the main character model as well as all of the environmental assets.  I wasinspired from seeing "Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild", and I wanted to base the art style of our game off of this.  Eventually I created Alexa V2, the second version of the Alexa project.
    
## Alexa3
 
We haven't started on the third version of the project yet, because we are busy searching for jobs at the moment.  However we are looking forward to creating the third and final version of this game which we will keep as our main portfolio game.
