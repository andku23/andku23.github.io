<h1>Alexa I</h1>


          Alexa I or Alexa version 1.0 was a project my best friend and 
    talented coder, Shuhei Aoki, worked on for the summer of 2017. The goal 
    of this project was to learn the workflow of developing a game from start
    to finish. We also wanted to have a game to put on our portfolio when we
    applied for jobs since we did not have any prior games to show.  As always
    I took over the art side of the project (3d Modeling, texturing rigging, 
    animating, environment design), and Shuhei took over the programming half 
    of the project (Character Control, Camera Rig, Game Logic, Enemy AI).  
    Between the two of us we created the entire game, which we name Alexa V1.
    
          After designing our first game, we realized that there were a lot of
    parts that we rushed, and a lot of parts we could do better.  With this, 
    we decided that we would redesign the game from scratch over the next 
    semester.
    
<h1>Alexa II</h1>


         Alexa II (Alexa version 2.0), was the second iteration of the Alexa
    project.  For this version, I took up the majority of the programming as 
    well as the art, since my professor gave me the green light to turn this in 
    as the final project for his class.  The first thing I had to do was learn 
    the design structure that Shuhei used to make the game work.  This was 
    probably the hardest part.  Not because the code was messy, because he did a
    very good job of keeping things organized, but because of the pure bulk of 
    code that was in the game.  After I learned how the project worked, it was 
    pretty easy for me to incorporate new features to the game.

        The other part of the project I had to complete was the artistic side. 
    I was not satisfied with my art from the first version of the game so I 
    wanted to do a complete artistic overhaul.  This meant completely recreating
    the main character model as well as all of the environmental assets.  I was
    inspired from seeing "Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild", and I wanted to 
    base the art style of our game off of this.  Eventually I created Alexa V2,
    the second version of the Alexa project.
    
<h1>Alexa III</h1>
 
         We haven't started on the third version of the project yet, because we
    are busy searching for jobs at the moment.  However we are looking forward 
    to creating the third and final version of this game which we will keep as
    our main portfolio game.
