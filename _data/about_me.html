  I am a undergraduate senior in computer engineering at UH Manoa, about to graduate this semester.  I am looking to find a job in any computer related profession whether it be software engineering or web development.  I have experience in a multitude of different languages from high-level languages like C#, Python, and Java, to lower-level languages like C.  I've even had to write in Verilog a couple times for a school project but I'm not very good at it.  I have a lot of respect for those who can write in Verilog because it makes me go crazy.  I also have a general knowledge of web development frameworks like Meteor and React.
  Even with my degree in computer engineering, my true passion lies in game design.  For me, every part of a game from the art, to the game mechanics, writing, and even the music make me really happy.  I go to every single Game Jam I can, and work on personal game design projects as often as I can.  My dream is to one day become a successful game developer.  I realize this is not as easy as it sounds, which really just explains the degree in computer engineering.
  Back in high school, my friend and I made a pact to try and enter the field of game design together.  To divide the work we decided that he would become the programmer, and I would be the artist.  From then on I started teaching myself how to 3D model.  I taught myself using Blender because it was the easiest to get my hands on back then.  I also recently picked up ZBrush, and have also given some thought to using Maya since it is industry standard.  Since then I have expanded from just 3D models to learning things like texturing, and animating.  I learned to use Substance Painter because it makes life so much easier, and I do all my animating in Blender.  
  Recently I have picked up Shaders since it was a field I was pretty interested in.  Up until now, everything that happens inside the GPU was as good as magic.  Honestly I still don't have that much experience so a lot of it is still magic.  However I have found this field really interesting since it combines all of the things I like, or at least all of the things I can do.  It uses a lot of the low level coding that I learned in computer engineering, it interacts with a lot of the high level code that I use in game design, and it controls all of the aesthetics that I do in 3D design.  All of these factors make it very interesting for me to learn, and also a little easier to pick up.
