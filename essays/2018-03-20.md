   Overview
   Problem:
   Student have difficulty finding parking, and knowing where they can and cannot
   park. 
   
   Solution
   The solution to this problem would be to make a web app that allows students to
   create an account and select the parking passes that they own.  From this they would
   be able to see where are when they are able to park on campus.  
   
   Page Ideas
   Our landing page could have signin/create account pages where the user could make 
   their account, a personal page where they could select their passes, and finally a
   school map page with a slider bar for the time of day that allows them to see where
   they can park for what time.  
   
   Case Ideas
   -New user logs in, makes account, adds their passes, profit.
   -Regular user, logs on, it default sends them to the map, slider starts at current 
   time, and thats all.
   
   Beyond the Basics
   -It will give more information on where they can park at the current time.  Users could
   put in information like how long it took them to park, and where they parked, and the app
   would tell other users where is more empty at the time.
   -How long other users plan on parking in a place, so they know when certain parking lots will
   open up
   -Request parking from other user
