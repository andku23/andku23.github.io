   Overview
   Problem:
   Student have difficulty finding parking, and knowing where they can and cannot
   park. 
   
   Solution
   The solution to this problem would be to make a web app that allows students to
   create an account and select the parking passes that they own.  From this they would
   be able to see where are when they are able to park on campus.  
   
   Page Ideas
   Our landing page could have signin/create account pages where the user could make 
   their account, a personal page where they could select their passes, and finally a
   school map page with a slider bar for the time of day that allows them to see where
   they can park for what time.
